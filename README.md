## 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.
  A Blockchain is a trusted decentralized network that allows for transparent, secure, and fast transactions from one person to another. A Blockchain allows for transfer of digital values such as data or currency via smart contracts.
## 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is.
  A smart contract is a self-executing digital agreement that allows two or more people to exchange property, money, shares or anything of value transparently and in a conflict free way. When both parties involved in the smart contract agree to its terms, the program will automatically execute thus eliminating the need for a third party, as the contract is verified and enforced by the blockchain network.

   A Transaction is usually the only way to CHANGE data on the blockchain and has a varying "Gas" fee depending on which network you are using.
   
   A Script is used to VIEW data on the blockchain and does not have any associted fee.
